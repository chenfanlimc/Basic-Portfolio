            <p>My name is Chen Li. I am a first-generation immigrant from China. I was born in Chengdu, Sichuan province. 
                And I came to Utah when I was eight years old. I graduated from the University of Utah in 2009 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineer, 
                and met my wife the following year in a study abroad in Japan. I have been working in QA data analysis and SAP QA 
                module sysadmin positions for about five years.
            </p>

            <p>I currently work at a company called MasterControl, whose software is primarily Document Control, but whose application extends
                to Medical and Pharmaceutical industries. I love my job but also would love to expand my skillset to include web development and coding.
            </p>

            <p>
                My interests and hobbies include:
